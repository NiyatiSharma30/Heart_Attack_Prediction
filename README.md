# Heart_attack_prediction

Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Early prediction and diagnosis can significantly improve treatment outcomes. This project aims to develop a predictive model that assesses the risk of heart attack based on various clinical features.

The model utilizes a dataset comprising clinical features, including:
- Age
- Sex
- Chest pain type (cp)
- Resting blood pressure (trtbps)
- Serum cholesterol (chol)
- Fasting blood sugar (fbs)
- Resting ECG results (restecg)
- Maximum heart rate achieved (thalachh)
- Exercise induced angina (exng)
- Oldpeak (depression of ST segment)
- Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (slp)
- Number of major vessels (caa)
- Thalassemia (thall)
